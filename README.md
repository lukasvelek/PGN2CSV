# PGN2CSV
PGN2CSV is a Java project that converts PGN file to CSV.
It is written in Java, so it is faster than other converting programs written in other languages.

## Usage
It can be run either from the IDE or as a JAR through CMD or Terminal.
The PGN file that will be used for exporting can be passed either through parameters or the program will ask for it explicitly through the terminal.

## Description
It exports only columns I was going to use. It is defined in a not very nice way, but it works.

## Speed
I used it to export 8GB PGN file with around 109,000,000 lines of information. Out of that I got around 9,000,000 lines of CSV code with the information I wanted.
